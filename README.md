MultiplayerSet is a game in which you try to find sets of three cards out of a board of twelve cards. Which cards form sets depends on the four traits that each card has:

Shape: oval, diamond, or squiggle
Color: red, blue, or green
Amount of shapes: one, two, or three
Shading: solid, hollow, or striped

A set is three cards where all the traits on the three cards are either all the same (OR) all different (OR) any mixture of same and different traits. Here the cards have number and shape in common with different color and shading.
